        <p>On cruise ships, croupiers don’t just manage games—they’re the face of the casino. With international guests, loud environments, and fast-paced gameplay, effective communication is the difference between a smooth, enjoyable experience and misunderstandings, disputes, or lost revenue.</p>
        <p>This module breaks down the key skills you need to communicate clearly, build trust, and keep the energy high—whether you’re speaking, listening, or using nonverbal cues.</p>

        <h3>The "Why" Behind Clear Communication</h3>
        <p>Communication is more than just talking—it’s about connecting with players and your team. Here’s why it’s critical on cruise ships:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Diverse International Audience:</strong> Cruise guests come from dozens of countries. Clear communication avoids confusion about rules, bets, or payouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Loud, Energetic Environments:</strong> Casinos on ships are often noisy. You need to be heard and understood without shouting.</li>
          <li><strong>Prevent Disputes:</strong> Misinterpreted bets or unclear rules are the #1 cause of casino conflicts. Clear communication stops issues before they start.</li>
          <li><strong>Build Trust & Loyalty:</strong> Friendly, professional communication makes guests feel welcome—encouraging them to play longer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Speaking Clearly & Effectively</h3>
        <p>Verbal communication is your primary tool—here’s how to make it count:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Speak slowly and enunciate words (avoid mumbling).</li>
          <li>Use short, simple sentences—avoid complex jargon.</li>
          <li>Repeat key information (e.g., "No more bets—last call!").</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Tone & Energy</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep your tone friendly and professional.</li>
          <li>Match the game’s energy: Excited for craps; calm for baccarat.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Adapt to Language Barriers</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Use basic English or common phrases in other languages (e.g., "Bonjour", "Konnichiwa").</li>
          <li>Use gestures to support words (e.g., point to the bet area).</li>
